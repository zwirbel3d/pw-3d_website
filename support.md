# Support & FAQ

## Getting Started
- **Belt Tuner:** Tap **Start** and lightly pluck the belt. A large Hz readout appears with a target marker if set. Tap **Preset** to choose a model or **Set manual target…** to enter a value.
- **Maintenance:** Track recurring tasks. Swipe **right** to complete; tap **+ Add** for new tasks.

## iCloud Sync (optional)
- Enable in-app: **Settings → Sync via iCloud** (OFF by default).
- Requires **iCloud Drive** and the same Apple ID on each device.
- Data is stored in **your iCloud account**; we do not run servers.

### How do I enable sync between my iPhone and iPad?
1. On both devices: iOS **Settings → [your name] → iCloud → iCloud Drive = On**, enabled for CalibraOps.  
2. In CalibraOps: **Settings → Sync via iCloud = On**.  
3. Leave the app in the foreground briefly after edits; sync happens in the background.

### Nothing is syncing — what can I check?
- Same Apple ID on both devices.  
- iCloud Drive enabled for CalibraOps.  
- Network available.  
- Make a small change (e.g., edit a task) and wait a minute.  
- (Advanced) Export JSON to confirm data exists locally.

### How do I remove my data from iCloud?
- Turn off **Sync via iCloud** in CalibraOps (on-device data remains).  
- iOS **Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Manage Storage → CalibraOps** → Delete Data.

## Belt Tuner Tips
- Hold the phone steady; pluck near the middle of the span.  
- Use the **Preset** sheet to set a target, or enter one manually.  
- A light haptic fires after ~0.3 s **inside tolerance** of your target.

## Privacy & Audio
- No analytics, no ads, no tracking.  
- Audio analysis is **on-device only**; audio is **not recorded or uploaded**.  
- iCloud Sync is **optional** and stores data in **your iCloud**.
