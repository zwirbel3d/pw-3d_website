Questions about **CalibraOps** (iOS/Android)? Contact us at **[support@pw-3d.de](mailto:support@pw-3d.de)**.

**Quick Help:**

- Microphone access is only required in the **Belt Tool**.
- Measurement not working? Reduce background noise, pluck the belt gently at its center span, then damp it briefly.
- Simple Mode shows only the frequency (Hz); “Landing Strip” and **Direction Coach** are available in Standard Mode.
- **Unlock Toolkit** (one-time): Enables Save/Presets/Export/Checklists.
