## 1. Summary
CalibraOps is an **offline-first** iOS app for 3D-printer belt tuning and maintenance. We do **not** run app servers, collect analytics, or show ads. All microphone processing happens **on-device**.  
If you optionally enable **iCloud Sync** in the app, your data is stored in **your iCloud account** to keep it available across your devices (iPhone/iPad). You can turn this off at any time.

## 2. What data the app handles
- **App data (on your device):** printer names and metadata, maintenance tasks & schedules, task completion timestamps, tool/preset settings, in‑app preferences.
- **Microphone (on-device only):** used solely to estimate belt frequency in real time. Audio is **not recorded**, **not uploaded**, and remains on the device.
- **iCloud Sync (optional):** when enabled by you, a copy of your app data is stored in your **iCloud** so Apple can sync it between your devices. No developer servers are involved.
- **Support contact (optional):** if you email us, we process your message and contact details for support.

## 3. Why we process data & legal bases
- **App functionality (contract / Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):** to provide belt tuning, presets, and maintenance features locally on your device.
- **iCloud Sync (at your direction / Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):** to make your data available on devices signed into your Apple ID when you switch the feature on.
- **Support (legitimate interests / Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):** to answer questions and resolve issues you raise.
- **Legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR):** if applicable (e.g., tax/record keeping for purchases outside the app).

## 4. Storage, retention & location
- **On-device:** your primary data lives in the app’s storage. It is included in your **iCloud device backups** (managed by Apple), unless you disable device backups.
- **iCloud (optional):** when you enable Sync in Settings, a copy of your app data is kept in your **iCloud** (iCloud Drive/CloudKit space) so Apple can sync across devices.
- **No developer servers:** we do not run infrastructure for CalibraOps; we do not receive your app data.
- **Deletion:** you can delete data inside the app. To remove the iCloud copy, go to **Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Manage Storage → CalibraOps** and delete the app’s iCloud data.
- **Retention:** we retain support emails only as long as needed to assist you, unless law requires longer.

## 5. Your rights (GDPR/EEA)
You can request **access**, **rectification**, **erasure**, **restriction**, and **data portability**, and object to processing where applicable. You can also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Contact us via **support@pw-3d.de** to exercise your rights.

## 6. Sharing & international transfers
- We **do not sell** data and **do not share** app data with third parties for marketing.
- If you enable iCloud Sync, your data is processed by **Apple’s iCloud** under Apple’s terms. International transfers (if any) are handled by Apple as described in Apple’s privacy policy.
- Audio never leaves your device.
