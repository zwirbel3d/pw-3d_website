**Person responsible for content under § 18(2) MStV (Germany):**  
Philipp Wenk, Mörikeweg 3, 89278 Nersingen, Germany

**Note:** The **CalibraOps** app works offline; no accounts, no tracking, no advertising.

**Dispute Resolution:** The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution: <https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr>  
We are not obligated or willing to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.

## 1. Scope
CalibraOps is an **offline-first** iOS app for belt tuning and maintenance. We do not run app servers, collect analytics, or serve ads. The app functions without internet access; optional iCloud features are controlled by you.

## 2. iCloud Storage & Sync
If you enable **Sync via iCloud** in the app, CalibraOps writes your app data (e.g., printers, maintenance, presets) into **your iCloud account** so Apple can sync it across devices signed into your Apple ID. iCloud is provided by Apple under Apple’s terms. We do **not** operate servers for CalibraOps and do **not** access or control your iCloud content.

## 3. Safety & Use
Belt tension guidance and analyzer readouts are tools—not guarantees. Always verify fit and safety before operating a printer. You remain responsible for hardware changes and their consequences.

## 4. Intellectual Property
App code, UI, and content are © their respective owners. Trademarks and brand names belong to their owners. You may not reverse engineer or redistribute the app except as allowed by applicable law.

## 5. Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect or consequential damages arising from use of the app. Nothing in this notice excludes liability that cannot be excluded by law.

## 6. Contact
For legal or support inquiries, email **support@pw-3d.de**.
